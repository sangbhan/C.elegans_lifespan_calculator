# Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan prediction

I coded this program for Artificial Intelligence course project (Spring 2018 semester, Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang).

This program uses a hidden Markov model to predict Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) lifespan from early adulthood health data.

Data used in this project were obtained from Zhang et al (Cell Systems, 2016).

Early adulthood physiological data (0-2 adult day) that I used are
1. Movement
2. Body size
3. Area of eggs laid
