# Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan prediction

This program for Artificial Intelligence course project (Spring 2018 semester, Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang) (<https://bi.snu.ac.kr/Courses/4ai18s/4ai18s.html>).

This program uses a hidden Markov model to predict Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) lifespan from its early adulthood health data.

Data used in this project were obtained from Zhang et al (Cell Systems, 2016) (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.09.003>).

Early adulthood physiological data (0-2 adult day) of C.elegans, that I used for this project, are
1. Movement
2. Body size
3. Area of eggs laid
