# Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan prediction

I coded this program for Artificial Intelligence course project (Spring 2018 semester, Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang).

This program uses a hidden Markov model to predict Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) lifespan from its early adulthood health data.

Data used in this project were obtained from Zhang et al (Cell Systems, 2016).

Early adulthood physiological data (0-2 adult day) of C.elegans, that I used for this project, are
1. Movement
2. Body size
3. Area of eggs laid
